Feature: Books by author name
    Scenario Outline: Correct non-zero number of books found by author
        Given I have the following books in the store
            | title                                | author       |
            | The Devil in the White City          | Erick Larson |
            | The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrope | C.S.Lewis    |
            | In the Garden of Beast               | Erick Larson |
        When I search for the books by author "<author>"
        Then I find <countOfBooks> books
        Examples:
            | author       | countOfBooks |
            | Erick Larson | 2            |
            | C.S.Lewis    | 1            |
